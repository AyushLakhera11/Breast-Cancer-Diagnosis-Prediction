# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Prediction
The objective of this project is to analyze the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to understand the key differences between benign and malignant tumors through both data visualization and statistical testing. Furthermore, machine learning models are applied to predict tumor diagnosis (Benign vs. Malignant) based on cell features.
